
This is the path to fuseki
/home/cconduff/apache-jena-fuseki-2.3.1

This is the path to the development folder for the application
/home/cconduff/Development/GeoSparqlViz3

This is the path to the production folder for the application
/RAID/CEGIS_Datasets/ontology/code/SemanticNationalMap/geosparql

useful commands for production app/folder:
	// to get the latest version from github
	git pull 

	// precompile the code
	RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile

	// restart the apache server
	// ask Jeff Wendel for help if this doesn't work 
	sudo systemctl restart httpd



There are several other folders under /SemanticNationalMap
geosparqlVERSION2, geosparqlviz, NewGeoSparqlViz, sparqlparty

sparqlparty was version 2 of the application
It uses ruby on rails

geosparqlviz was David Mattli's original version of the application
It uses an older version of Django

NewGeoSparqlViz was an updated version of Django
I think that it is also the location of the production version 
although that may be geosparqlVERSION2



If a student contractor is reading this:
ask Jeff Wendel or Brian Kawano if you need help 
with Apache, Phusion Passenger, etc.
